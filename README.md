# Auth Master - React + Vite Authentication App

Welcome to Auth Master, a powerful React + Vite application designed to streamline user authentication with seamless integration of Firebase services. This application leverages the synergy of React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Daisy UI, and Firebase to deliver a robust authentication experience.

## Key Features

### 1. User Registration
New visitors can effortlessly register on the Auth Master platform by navigating to the dedicated Register route. The registration process is user-friendly and ensures a smooth onboarding experience.

### 2. Login and Sign-In
Returning visitors have the option to log in or sign in through the Login route. The authentication process supports both email and password credentials, as well as the convenience of Google Authentication for a quicker and hassle-free login experience.

### 3. Protected Routes
To ensure the security of user data, certain routes, including Profile and Orders, are protected and accessible only to authorized users. Unauthorized users won't be able to view these routes, creating a secure environment for sensitive information.

### 4. User-Friendly Navigation
For authorized users, the application's header section dynamically displays their name, providing a personalized touch. Additionally, a logout button is readily available for quick access to log out, enhancing user convenience.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
